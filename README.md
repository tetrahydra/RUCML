RUC Machine Learning Project

Despite the number of established machine learning libraries for Python is quite established out there, this project aims is not to build another library to compete with them. It is more for co-student to explore the mathematical concepts behind neural network.

Face recognition has been chosen because it also involves some mathematical procedures, therefore giving an additional exposure in designing a dataset.

This project was first developed for "Subject Module in Computer Science" at Roskilde University in spring 2019.
